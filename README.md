<h1>🚗Car Price Analysis</h1>

  <p>Used car prices analysis using python and pandas

<h2>📌About the project</h2>

<p>This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset of used car prices, identifying patterns and relationships between variables such as brand, age, mileage, and number of owners. In addition, a linear regression model was applied to predict the price of vehicles based on age.</p>

<h2>Analyzes performed</h2>

✔️ Vehicle count by brand

✔️ Calculation of vehicle age

✔️ Price distribution and identification of outliers

✔️ Correlation matrix between numerical variables

✔️ Visualization of the relationship between price and car age

✔️ Application of linear regression for price prediction

<h2>📈 Visualizations and Modeling</h2>

Some of the visualizations generated include:

📌 Price histogram to understand the distribution of values

📌 Boxplots to compare prices between different brands

📌 Correlation heatmap to identify relationships between variables

📌 Linear regression to predict price based on car age
